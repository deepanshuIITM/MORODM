# MORODM
Multi-objective Robust Optimization and Decision-making using Evolutionary Algorithm

The existing EMO literature on robustness studies emphasized on finding the entire robust front, 
but hardly considered robustness in both optimization and decision-making tasks. In this work, 
we propose and evaluate different algorithmic implementations of three aspects – multi-objective 
optimization, robustness consideration, and multi-criterion decision-making – together. Based on 
experimental results on two to eight-objective problems, we discuss the outcomes and advantages of 
different integration approaches of these three aspects and present the most effective combined approach. 
The work should pave the way to develop more efficient multi-objective robust optimization and 
decision-making (MORODM) procedures for handling practical problems with uncertainties
